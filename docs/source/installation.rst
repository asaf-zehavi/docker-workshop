Required Installations
======================

Docker Desktop
--------------
This installation includes both the docker engine backend that is required, and a graphic user interface which is pretty
shitty but still occasionally useful. I highly recommend installing it, even though installing only the docker engine
will also suffice.

* Installation should be a relatively simple next-next-next affair. Download from here:
  https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/.
* When prompted, ensure the ``Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V`` option on the Configuration page is selected.

PyCharm Pro
-----------
We'll use this to demonstrate some neat perks that come with integrating dockers with your IDE & workflow.
This is less important, and if you don't use PyCharm normally - I wouldn't necessarily bother.
However, if you do - it's worth upgrading to pro anyway :)

We should all be eligible for a free pro JetBrains licence because we're students or faculty in an academic institution.
To sign up for your free license - follow instructions here: https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students.

Then, make sure you download PyCharm Pro instead of any community edition version you may currently have installed.
