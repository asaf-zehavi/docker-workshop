Required Installations
======================

Docker Desktop
--------------
This installation includes both the docker engine backend that is required, and a graphic user interface which is pretty
shitty but still occasionally useful. I highly recommend installing it, even though installing only the docker engine
will also suffice.

* Installation instructions can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/ *(instructions
  for Mac & Linux installation are a click away)*.
* When prompted, ensure the ``Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V`` option on the Configuration page is selected.
