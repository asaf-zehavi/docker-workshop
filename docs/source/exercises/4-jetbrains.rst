Tutorial #4 - JetBrains Integration
===================================

In this tutorial we'll learn how to integrate a Docker deployment environment with our PyCharm project.

If you haven't done so already - this is the time to upgrade to PyCharm Pro. See how in :ref:`installation`.

One of the upsides to using dockers is that you can get the same environment everywhere. This allows for a nice
opportunity for using your IDE - you can run your code on your computer in the exact same environment as it will run
when you deploy it.

This time, instead of writing the instructions myself - I'll let you follow JetBrains very understandable instructions:

While this feature is not a game changer, I certainly do find it convenient...
