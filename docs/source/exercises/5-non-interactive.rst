Tutorial #5 - Running Tasks Non-Interactively
=============================================

.. sectnum::

This would usually be considered the basics, however it is less relevant to our needs.
In this tutorial we'll learn to run dockers non-interactively (and in the background), to mount local drives and to make
containers accessible from the network.

This tutorial is more of a bonus one - as it is way less relevant to our regular tasks, but is considered basic in many
other settings.
